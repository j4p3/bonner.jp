blurb: "That show (and its comic) were so good it was unbelievable it ever got made. Its creator used the tactics of one of the greatest pieces of art of all time - Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov - to explore Black American identity in a way that's rarely seen, and it worked. It was compelling, it was an education, it was hilarious."

In 2006, Black activist Reverend Al Sharpton demanded Cartoon Network apologize for airing an episode of a cartoon in which - hold onto your hats - the word "nigga" comes out of Martin Luther King, Jr's mouth. He further demanded the episode be pulled from the series run, for "descrating" Black historic figures.

First of all, what the hell? Who in their right mind would air a racist cartoon on broadcast television? And second of all, why would Cartoon Network, home of Scooby Doo and and Powerpuff Girls, call the episode "a thought-provoking way of showing Dr. King's bravery"?

Anybody who knew about The Boondocks wouldn't have been surprised. It had already been pulled from publication (as a comic strip) from the NY Daily News for suggesting the US government's funding of Al Qaeda to fight the USSR laid the groundwork for 9/11 and from the Washington Post for suggesting getting Condoleeza Rice a boyfriend would make her less war-hungry. Its creator, Aaron McGruder, had already been heckled by his fellow cartoonists when - while accepting an industry award - he told them they were smug, self-satisfied liberals, and that he had voted for Nader over Gore.

* Dostoevesky firing squad
* his motivations
* Russian identity and The Brothers K
* Black identity and The Boondocks
* The Return of the King and The Grand Inquisitor

Both works' most famous episode envision the founder of a movement being rejected by the children of that movement. In The Brothers K, the intellectual brother lays out a story for his religious sibling in which Jesus has returned - into the middle of the Spanish Inquisition. But his message of peace, of caring, and, crucially, of individual freedom to choose, gets him tortured to death by the Grand Inquisitor. In The Boondocks, the returning leader is Martin Luther King, who is rejected by modern America for advocating a nonviolent response to 9/11 and eventually abandons the civil rights movement after berating his community for failing to carry on his legacy.

All cultures are fragmented. By bringing back the one figure who is unquestionably venerated by all facets of the community, the writer can examine a universally agreed-upon truth through the various lenses that fragmented culture provides.
