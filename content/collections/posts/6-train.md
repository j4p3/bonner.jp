This time last year, at about 3:30 AM on a Monday, I step onto a third-class rail car bound for Moscow. I’m on my way home from Beijing and I feel like an alien. The provodnik on night duty that fateful evening, seeing my overstuffed backpack, helpfully leads me through the cramped sleeping quarters to my bunk, which is already occupied. Nonplussed, she leaves me to sort out the confusion.

My fellow insomniacs have completed their compulsory year of military service at long last, and are returning home to their families for the first time. The situation is unfamiliar. It doesn’t call for skills in web development, finance, or sales. Russian skills would be helpful, but turn out to be unnecessary. We are young men on a train together in the middle of the night, tired, with pictures in our wallets, home on our minds, time and cigarettes to burn.

Sometime during the night I open my translation book and ask the one with the most English: *where are we?*

*On train*, he says, laughing off my pitiful attempt at Russian. *Where do you go?*

This one, I know how to answer. I start to explain my trip itinerary - meeting a friend in Amsterdam, Paris, family in Ireland. He’s shaking his head.

You have to get off train, he suggests. See Russia.

Huh.

##The right words at the right time.

Here’s what his advice meant to me: it’s terrifyingly easy to find myself stuck on rails, even when I’m not on the Trans-Siberian. Plans become prisons. When facing a big, scary, risky opportunity, it’s easy to dismiss it because it’s not part of the plan. It doesn’t feel like cowardice, it feels like sticking to my guns.

When planning a web application, it’s easy to waste time writing out an elaborately detailed plan. Later, I’ll be banging my head against the wall trying to make functions work the way I planned them to. Better to set tests for what the user should see, and find a way to make them work one by one.

I followed the Russian’s advice. Got off in Ulaanbatar, Irkutsk, Omsk, Moscow, and countless destinations in Europe. By the trip’s end, I had unwittingly helped a compartment full of Mongolian businessmen smuggle blue jeans from China. I helped some Canadian ex-special forces recover from being thrown into a pool over a boxing bet. I stayed up all night talking about dubstep and Total Annihilation, the excellent nineties computer game, with a hostel manager from LA. Getting off the train whenever the opportunity presented itself improved my trip by orders of magnitude.

I got back to school, where I was deep in the process of finding a job in consulting. Then thought about the Russian, decided to cast my net a little further afield, and landed in a startup boot camp. Working on a project to learn node.js, I thought about the Russian, and took opportunities to amend my plans on the fly.

I don’t pretend to know what I’m doing. My ‘hire me’ page lists experience in coding, sales, writing, teaching, design, and finance. My life has no particular trajectory, my career exhibits no discernible vector. The only physics analogue I aspire to is velocity.

At the moment, though, I’m looking for a gig as a web developer in a place where I can continue to learn. If you’re interested, send me an email.
