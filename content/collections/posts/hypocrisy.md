Ad hominem

A farmhand gazes at the clouds over his fields for a while, then calls over to his fellow to start carrying in the harvest, because rain is coming soon. The other farmhand calls back, "It's not going to rain - your boots are ugly."

Of course his response doesn't make sense: the farmhand's boots have nothing to do with whether he's right about the rain coming.

Sufficiency

A man accused of murder stands before the court. The prosecution's eyewitness swears on the Bible and solemnly tells the jury that the accused must be the murderer, because the murder was committed with the right hand, and the accused has a right hand.

Of course this accusation doesn't make sense: everybody in the courtroom has a right hand, and they're not being accused of murder.

Hypocrisy

A governmment representative votes for a bill allocating a huge sum of money to the military. Political commentators ridicule her for contradicting her previous statements on the need for fiscal restraint.

Does their ridicule make sense?

It depends. Why is fiscal restraint necessary? Why is military funding still more necessary? Are the representative's past statements relevant to the position she's taking now? Compared to these questions, the mere fact that she's contradicting herself means nothing.

An accusation of hypocrisy isn't an argument. It doesn't invalidate what someone is saying, even if their words are hypocrisy, and any such accusation can be disregarded in a conversation about whether an idea is right or true.

Hi, I'm a hypocrite. I am inconsistent. I say things and then change my mind, I act in ways that are inconsistent with my words and my values. Just like you, like everyone who's ever lived, there are a lot of concurrent processes running in my head and the consensus output I allow them to send out into the world rarely plots out a straight and unbending trajectory.

People love to argue. It's not such a terrible thing; we've been squabbling and jockeying for position in our little social circles since we fell out of the trees. Trying to outwit each other supplied the evolutionary selection pressure to develop these big old brains in the first place.

* Insufficiency of the hypocrisy charge - it applies to everybody
* Circularity of the hypocrisy charge - it applies to the accuser
* Religious charge of the attack by hypocrisy - everyone knows how Jesus laid into the pharisees
* Philosophical argument for hypocrisy - Emerson
* Evolutionary psychology argument for hypocrisy - jockeying for position is ape behavior
