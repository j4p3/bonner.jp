You're at a restaurant and you see some youngish folks making a ruckus in their booth.

It's for their finsta. Not their Insta, that public trophy shelf where the world witnesses their finest moments, their best looks, their dearest friends. Their finsta ("fake Insta") is for reality, and for acknowledging that reality often isn't pretty. It's captioned with anxiety and depression. Sometimes it might get a little too drunk.

There's a secret, parallel world happening on Instagram where people are allowed to be real.
