You're at a restaurant and you see some youngish folks making a ruckus in their booth. They're making faces into their phones for the little videos and photos they're taking - of their food, of each other's nostrils - blurrily capturing their own hilarity. What a waste, you might think in your best curmudgeonly old person's inner voice. Who's going to look at this stuff, anyway? Where are they going to post all this garbage?

You might expect that all these candid shots are going on their Instagram (or if you're sufficiently out of the loop, their Snapchat), but you'd be drastically underestimating these teens' social media savvy. They have better instincts. They didn't have social networks dropped into their laps while they were in college, and start gleefully post all manner of ill-advised content they way you did. They've been raised on this stuff.

Remember, today's college student has been socializing through their phone as easily as in the cafeteria since they were old enough to multiply. It wouldn't be wrong to say they've lived their entire adolescence in the constant, ephemeral presence of a loose crowd of their peers - which is another way of saying they've grown up under constant scrutiny.

So you'd be wrong, sitting there in your booth judging these kids' presumed Instagram feeds. The shots aren't going there at all.

They're for their finsta. Not their Insta, that public trophy shelf where the world witnesses their finest moments, their best looks, their dearest friends. Their finsta ("fake Insta") is for reality, and for the relief of acknowledging that reality often isn't pretty. Its captions come complete with anxiety and depression. Sometimes it might get a little too drunk. And no, you can't see it, because it's a private account. 

There is a secret, parallel world happening on Instagram where young people are allowed to be real.

Right now social networks are some of the most valuable properties on the planet, and historically their fates have been predicted by the next group to begin adoption: as oldschool web rings were replaced by MySpace, and as the pages of MySpace were replaced by Facebook which is being replaced by Instagram, so these trends will determine the next billion-dollar networks. Is anybody paying attention?

    - IJ excerpt
    - analysis

The idea that each of us has many faces we present to the world isn't particularly new. You can find it in Shakespeare or the Bible. What is new is the ever-escalating sense of irony we feel about our own lives - as if we can't genuinely experience joy or sorrow, at least, not in front of people. Such a display would just be so ... corny. Like a show. Instead, we're cool. We're detached. We're self-aware. We're in on the joke.

The culture of ironic detachment has been building for a while. David Foster Wallace, one of the greatest voices in recent memory, wrote about this phenomenon all the time. Here's Wallace in his speech to a graduating class at Kenyon College:

    this is water goo-prone

He thought

* Edwardians to victorians
    - generational reaction
    - FB is the place where you
    - what's the reaction when parents are glued to their phone?
    - what's the reaction when parents are obsessing over their like count?
* New Sincerity
    - radical honesty to startup yuppie types
    - real talk to teens
    - the goo-prone thing to DFW in this is water
* Evolution of social network
