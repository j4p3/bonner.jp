Basics, molly ringwald and the wrestler being the cool kids, the nerd and the artsy spaz girl being the outcasts. 21/2 jump st with the chads coming back to be ridiculed for being so basic.

out-groups through history - some overused label gets applied to whoever's currently the out-group - nerds, goth, emo. some little group. now it's basic. which is hilarious, because basic is just someone who is *not* in a niche group. for the first time ever, it's cool not to be cool. how fetchingly postmodern.
