## hi there.

<!-- ![hello](/v.jpg) -->

A few years ago, I set out to learn how people make great products on the internet. My primary research was traveling around the world writing code and creating things for clients. I wrote backends, managed teams, designed wireframes, built frontends, figured out client needs, architected schemas, interviewed end users, tested apps, and sold to prospective customers. It was pretty fun. I learned a lot.

### 48 projects and 19 countries later...

Now it's time to open up a new chapter. I've been tinkering with a co-op agency model and hacking on my own projects in the meantime, but I'd like the opportunity to invest in creating something over the long term with a great team.

#### *"JP never sleeps. Seriously. He worked with our development team, which was situated between New York City, Taiwan, and Greece, around the clock. In addition to his work ethic the creativity he brings to his development is refreshing."* - Maurice Wright, [Book&Table](https://www.bookandtable.com/)

#### *"I have never encountered a developer as skilled at explaining technical problems in plain language as JP."* - Bob Evans

I'm looking for a team solving big problems - whether it's delivering excellence at scale, or building something that's never been built before, or creating a uniquely delightful experience on a new platform, I'd like to help. I want to learn from your veterans and help teach your newcomers.

For some context, I've listed a few of the things I've made below. Or if you're into resumes, you can download mine here:
