## hi there.

<!-- ![hello](/v.jpg) -->

A few years ago, I set out to learn how people make great products on the internet. My primary research was traveling around the world writing code and creating things for clients. I wrote backends, I managed teams, I designed wireframes, I architected schemas, I interviewed end users, I built frontends, I sold to prospective customers. It was pretty fun. I learned a lot.

### 48 projects and 19 countries later...

Now it's time to open up a new chapter. I've been tinkering with a co-op agency model and hacking on my own projects in the meantime, but I'd like the opportunity to invest in creating something great over the long term with a great team.

#### *"JP built something rad for me that nobody else could have gotten done for the price he did."* - Alice White

#### *"I have never encountered a developer as skilled at explaining technical problems in plain language as JP."* - Bob Evans

I'm looking for a team solving big problems - whether it's delivering excellence at scale, or building something that's never been built before, or creating a uniquely delightful experience on a new platform, I'd like to help. I want to learn from your veterans and help teach your newcomers.

For some context, I've listed a few of the things I've made below. Or if you're into resumes, you can download mine here:
