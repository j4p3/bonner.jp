## hi there.

<!-- ![hello](/v.jpg) -->

A few years ago, I set out to learn how people make great products on the internet. My primary research was traveling around the world writing code and creating things for clients. It was pretty fun. I learned a lot.

### 58 projects, 19 countries, and 45 members later...

Now it's time to open up a new chapter. I've been tinkering with a co-op agency model and hacking on my own projects in the meantime, but I'd like the opportunity to invest in creating a really world-class product with a great team.

#### *"JP built something rad for me that nobody else could have gotten done for the price he did."* - A Person

#### *"I have never encountered a developer as skilled at explaining technical problems in plain language as JP."* - Another Person

I'm looking for a world-class team solving big problems - whether it's delivering excellence at scale, or building something that's never been built before, or creating a uniquely delightful experience on a new platform, I'd like to help. I want to learn from your veterans and help teach your newcomers.

For some context, I've listed a few of the things I've made below. Or if you're into resumes, you can download mine here:
